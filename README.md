# TSP
Traditional Graph Theory Method and Intelligent Optimization Method （Approximate Method）include Local Search (Heuristic Algorithm，Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search),from an icpc beginner and a researcher perspective, include well-constructed code and in-detail annotation, also been visualized.

### introduction-to-TSP

In the world of "The theorem of computation complexity", there has four types of problem.

1. Polynomial Problem (P): Problems that can be solved in polynomial time.
2. Nondeterministic Polynominal Problem (NP) : Problems that can be proved true or false in polynominal time, but could not determine to solve in  polynomial time.
   
note : NP problem is not the complement of the P problem, as "N" is Nondeterministic instead of "Not"

3. NP-Complete (NPC) :

  （1） This is a NP problem
   (2) All NP problem can be reduced to it in Polynominal time

4. NP-Hard (NPH):
   
   Not necessary to be NP Problem.

Discribe them in a graph:
